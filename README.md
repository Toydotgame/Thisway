# Thisway _Light_
A speep-oriented fork of Thisway based on speed, reliability, and smaller filesizes.

## Usage
Same as the original:
```
/thisway <distance> [true/false]
```
`[true/false]` is optional.
`/tw` can be used in place of `/thisway` for quicker typing time.

## Version
Versions of Thisway Light come out a little bit after Thisway, due to me having to code the features twice. See the [Releases](https://github.com/Toydotgame/Thisway/releases) tab, as it'll have both versions come out in paralell.

## Features
* Same as normal Thisway, ecxept no Debug Mode.
* Extra speed.
* Small file size.

## To-Do
* Remove debug mode.
* Re-make `if()` statements.
